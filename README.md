# Workout-To-Do
Workout To-do is a web app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React &amp; Node.js). I developed this project using React.js in its frontend where users can see their respective planned workouts' details. The backend is built using MongoDB and Node.js.

Users can log in/ Sign up/ Log out with authorization. Users can add new workout to their own list, can view and delete them.
